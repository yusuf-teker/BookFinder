# Booktopia

What can you do in this application?
- You can find the books provided by the Google Book Api and add them to your favorites within the application.
- You can select books as I have read, will read and am reading and filter them on the favorites page.
- You can add notes to the book you added to your favorites and view these notes later.
- You will be able to see which books other people using the application have read the most and which books they have added to their favourites. (under development)
